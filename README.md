# NASA's APOD With Parallax

## Brief Description

This website allows you to view NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day by selecting the desired date. Signing up allows the user to view, download, and manage their favorite images in HD quality. As an added bonus, users will also be able to view the pic of the day with added effects (works best on mobile and tablet).

## Experience

The purpose of this project was to share the beautiful sights of space with the user. I am a big fan of space and wanted to use NASA's APIs to give information to the user. Originally I had planned to use multiple APIs that would give sounds from space and space events but those APIs were not working. Because of this, I focused mainly on the visual aspects of space. I added the parallax effect as a bonus feature to further enhance the experience.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node/Express, Sequelize, & NASA's APOD API

## Problems

Due to time constraints I was not able to get the parallax effect as clean as I wanted. It is very basic and does not work well with all images. In addition, the favorites database is not functioning on heroku. This means that when a registered user tries to save an image or go to the gallery, the website will crash.
